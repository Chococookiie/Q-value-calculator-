# Q-value-calculator-
Calcutate the Q value for a given equtaion.

Use the following sample equation as sample input. ( Check console to see the flow and working of code )

4He + 14N = 17O + 1H

The Atomic Mass of the elements is fetched from the api -  https://github.com/neelpatel05/periodic-table-api using the symbol of the element and the Q value is calculated by using the formula :- 

Q value = (reactantMass - productMass) * c^2
